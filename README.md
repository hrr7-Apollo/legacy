## Development

### Setup
Have `gulp` installed

Enter `npm start` in one terminal window

Run `gulp` in the root of the project in a different terminal window. This will start the `gulp watch` task, which runs js-hint and builds the project files in the public folder.

Every time a change is made in the client folder, the project will be re-built and placed in the public folder in real-time. One of the tasks automatically run by gulp watcher during this step is `browserify-dev`, which executes very quickly, but produces a huge concatenated js file. Therefore this is suitable (and convenient) only for development purposes.

### Installing Dependencies

Have bower and node installed.

From within the root directory run:

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Loading sample bill data

In your terminal, run mongodb by typing in the command
```
mongod
```

In a new terminal tab, switch into the server folder, enter the mongo shell by using the command
```
mongo
```

Select the 'legacy' database by running the command
```
use legacy
```
and run the following commands:

```
load('billSeedFile.js');
db.billentries.createIndex( { terms: "text" } );
```

## Road Map

Questions:
- what database management system are we using?
- are we deploying on Heroku? something else?

Back-end team:
[x] implement a database
[x] when a user searches for a senator, check if that person has already been stored if not, grab query the api for that person and store it in the database
[x] when a user searches for a senator recent votes, check if those votes has already been stored if not, grab query the api for that person and store it in the database
- Updated tests to reflect the new architecture with the caching layer
- Refactor and cleanup the server.js (abstracting and definign away all the callbacks for the cacheOnDB() )

Stretch:
[x] research into getting bulk data of bills for keywords - Too costly and against our space complexity costs
- Add logic to invalidate cache after a sepcified amount fo time
- if we can get the keywords from bulk calls, try storing bills from limited time period (ie last 30 days) for easy keyword-searching
- on user searching for a keyword, query the database for recent bills with that keyword, then store in the database for future searches

Front-end team:
- implement geolocation to find the user's state - DONE
- show/suggest senators for that state - DONE
- research development with heroku (any limitations for database/storage?)

Stretch:
- add ui improvements/slight design
